# PrusaSlicer 2.1.1 DRIBBLING V.B01

This is a Fork of the PrusaSlicer 2.1.1
You may want to check the [PrusaSlicer project page](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).
For information on PrusaSlicer check the [PrusaSlicer project page](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).
Prebuilt Windows, OSX and Linux binaries are available through the [git releases page](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases) or from the [Prusa3D downloads page](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/).

## What are the PrusaSlicer's DRIBBLING features compared to the original PrusaSlicer?

PrusaSlicer DRIBBLING version **is capable to produce better filament tips during MMU2 filament change with wipe tower, and to handle transitions from materials with different melting temperatures in multicolor mode (e.g. PLA to PETG, PLA to ABS, etc.)**
I had developed it especially for PLA filaments, in order to use bad quality / low cost filaments spools with MMU2.

### Where are those features ?

On the `Print settings` tab, selecting Multiple Extruders on the left, you can find a new checkbox in Advanced group:

- **DRIBBLING MODE** (on/off) -> if you do not enable dribbling mode, it works exactly as the standard PrusaSlicer.
If Dribbling mode is enabled, during the MMU2S filament change, just before extracting the filament, it plays with the filament doing a sort of dribbling and each hit of the filament in the melting area shapes the head almost squared, limiting the strings and strange big balls shapes to the minimum.

On the `Filament settings` tab, there are 3 new fields in the Temperature group:

- **MANUFACTURER MIN TEMP° and MAX TEMP°** ->  Those are the manufacturer printing specification **temperature** (in C°) of the filament, normally printed on the roll.
Normally under the MIN TEMP the filament does not melt, and over the MAX TEMP the filament degrades or burn.

- **DRIBBLING TIP SHAPE** temperature -> This is the ideal **temperature** (in C°) at which the tip shaping comes better. It is a matter of experimentation, and each filament could be different.

On the `Filament settings` tab, selecting Advanced on the left, you can find a new parameter in Toolchange Parameters with single extruder MM printers group:

- **NUMBER OF DRIBBLING MOVES** -> This number represent how many times the filament is Dribbled up and down hitting the melted area to perform the perfect tip shape. A reasonable number is between 1 and 4. 

On the `Printer settings` tab, selecting Single Extruder MM setup on the left, you can find a new parameter:

- **MELTING DISTANCE** (do not change) -> It represents how many mm the filament is dropped down from the rest position to just hit the melted area. This should allow to just hit the melted surface and not going deep into it.
